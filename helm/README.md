This chart will install the components required to run the Debezium Platform.

1. Conductor: The back-end component which provides a set of APIs to orchestrate and control Debezium deployments.
2. Stage: The front-end component which provides a user interface to interact with the Conductor.
3. Debezium operator: operator that manages the creation of Debezium Server custom resource.
4. [Optional] PostgreSQL database used by conductor to store its data.
5. [Optional] Strimzi operator: operator for creating Kakfa cluster. In case you want to use a Kafka destination in you
   pipeline.

When monitoring is enabled, the chart also creates:
1. An `OpenTelemetryCollector` custom resource, which requires the OpenTelemetry Operator to already be installed.
2. [Optional] A `ServiceMonitor`, which requires the Prometheus Operator to already be installed.

More details in the [Monitoring](#monitoring) section. 

# Prerequisites

The chart use an ingress to expose `debezium-stage (UI)` and `debezium-conductor (backend)`,
this will require to have
an [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) installed in you
cluster.
You need also to have domain that must point to the cluster IP and then configure the `domain.name` property in
you `values.yaml` with your domain.

### Monitoring

The platform's built-in monitoring features require an OpenTelemetry Collector to collect metrics from Debezium Server instances. 
The following operators must be installed in the cluster **before** deploying the chart with monitoring enabled (`monitoring.otel.enabled: true`):

1. **[OpenTelemetry Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator)** — manages the `OpenTelemetryCollector` custom resource that the chart creates.
   Install via Helm:
   ```shell
   helm repo add open-telemetry https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts
   helm install opentelemetry-operator open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator
   ```

2. **[Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator)** (optional) — required only if you want the chart to create a `ServiceMonitor` for automatic Prometheus scraping (`monitoring.prometheus.serviceMonitor.enabled: true`). 
3. Commonly installed via the [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) chart:
   ```shell
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
   helm install kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
   ```

> **Note:** When monitoring is enabled you must set `monitoring.prometheus.url` to point to your Prometheus instance
> so that the conductor can query metrics. This is required regardless of how Prometheus was installed (operator, standalone, etc.).
> For example, if you installed `kube-prometheus-stack` in the `monitoring` namespace with default settings:
> ```yaml
> monitoring:
>   prometheus:
>     url: "http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090"
> ```

> **Note:** The OTel Collector must include the **Prometheus exporter**. The base `otelcol` distribution
> includes it, but when the OTel Operator is installed via Helm it defaults to the `otelcol-k8s` distribution
> which does **not**. If your operator uses the `k8s` distribution, set `monitoring.otel.collector.image`
> to override it with the base or contrib image, e.g.:
> - Base: `ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector:0.152.0`
> - Contrib: `ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.152.0`
>
> See [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) for available distributions and their included components.

## Alerting

The platform includes a built-in alerting engine that evaluates rules against Prometheus metrics and sends notifications via webhook or email channels. The evaluation loop runs on the configured interval and is a no-op when no rules exist, so no toggle is needed.

Alert rules and notification channels (webhook, email) are managed from the UI. The Helm values configure the infrastructure that supports them: evaluation timing, history retention, webhook retry policy, and SMTP server settings for email delivery.

### Email Notifications

To enable email notifications, configure the SMTP server settings. Email channels are created and enabled from the UI; the Helm values provide the underlying transport configuration.

```yaml
alerting:
  email:
    host: smtp.example.com
    port: 587
    from: alerts@example.com
    startTls: REQUIRED
    auth:
      existingSecret: smtp-credentials
```

The `existingSecret` must be a Kubernetes Secret with `username` and `password` keys:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic smtp-credentials \
  --from-literal=username=myuser \
  --from-literal=password=mypassword
```

If no SMTP host is configured, email channels will report a clear error when tested or triggered from the UI.

### Webhook Notifications

Webhook channels are configured entirely from the UI (URL, headers, etc.). The Helm values control retry and timeout behavior:

```yaml
alerting:
  webhook:
    maxAttempts: 5
    connectTimeout: "10S"
    readTimeout: "30S"
```

**Security (SSRF protection):** By default, webhook URLs that resolve to private (`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`), loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`), or link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`) addresses are blocked. This prevents user-supplied URLs from probing internal cluster services. If you need to send webhooks to internal endpoints (e.g., an in-cluster Slack relay), set:

```yaml
alerting:
  webhook:
    allowPrivateNetworks: true
```

## Descriptor OCI Artifacts

The conductor uses OCI artifacts containing component descriptors (JSON files) for connectors and transformations. This enables the platform to:
- Discover available connectors and transformations
- Render UI forms for configuration
- Validate pipeline configurations

### How it Works

At conductor startup, the OCI artifact is downloaded using **ORAS** (OCI Registry as Storage):
- Downloads the descriptor OCI artifact to local filesystem
- Extracts all descriptor JSON files
- Adds ~5-15 seconds to startup time
- Works on any Kubernetes version

### Configuration

The official Debezium descriptors are enabled by default:

```yaml
conductor:
  descriptors:
    official:
      enabled: true
      registry: quay.io
      image: debezium/debezium-descriptors
      tag: nightly
      mountPath: /opt/descriptors
```

To use a specific version:

```yaml
conductor:
  descriptors:
    official:
      enabled: true
      tag: 3.5.0  # Override just the tag
```

To disable descriptors:

```yaml
conductor:
  descriptors:
    official:
      enabled: false
```

### OCI Artifact Structure

Descriptor OCI artifacts should follow this structure:

```
debezium-descriptors:nightly
└── <version>/
    ├── manifest.json
    ├── source-connector/
    │   └── io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector.json
    └── transformation/
        └── io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState.json
```

The artifact contents are extracted to the configured `mountPath`.

## Extra Conductor Volumes

Additional volumes and volume mounts can be configured for the conductor container. This can be used, for example, to mount a ConfigMap containing a custom truststore.

```yaml
conductor:
  extraVolumes: 
    - name: truststore 
      configMap: 
        name: conductor-truststore
  extraVolumeMounts: 
    - name: truststore 
      mountPath: /etc/truststore 
      readOnly: true
```

## Debezium Server Image Configuration

By default, when pipelines are created, the Debezium Operator's `ServerImageProvider` automatically determines which Debezium Server image to use based on the configured version and connector type.

However, you can override this behavior and specify a custom Debezium Server image that will be used for all pipelines:

```yaml
server:
  image: quay.io/debezium/server:3.0.0.Final
```

### Use Cases

- **Pinning to a specific version**: Ensure all pipelines use a specific Debezium Server version
  ```yaml
  server:
    image: quay.io/debezium/server:3.0.0.Final
  ```

- **Using custom server image**: Deploy pipelines with a customized Debezium Server image
  ```yaml
  server:
    image: myregistry.io/custom-debezium-server:latest
  ```

- **Default behavior**: Leave empty to let the operator decide
  ```yaml
  server:
    image: ""  # Operator's ServerImageProvider determines the image
  ```

## Pipeline Labels

You can configure labels that will be applied to all DebeziumServer custom resources created by pipelines. These labels are merged with the internal `debezium.io/conductor-id` label that is always set automatically.

This is useful for integrating with tools like ArgoCD that rely on labels to track and group resources.

### Configuration

```yaml
pipeline:
  labels:
    argocd.argoproj.io/instance: debezium-platform
    team: data-engineering
```

The labels are automatically converted to environment variables for the Conductor pod (e.g., `PIPELINE_LABELS_ARGOCD_ARGOPROJ_IO_INSTANCE`).

## Pipeline Workload Identity

Pipelines can fetch their database credentials from an external secret store (OpenBao, or any Vault-compatible API) instead of having the password copied into the DebeziumServer resource and its ConfigMap. Enabling `pipeline.vault.enabled` gives every pipeline pod its own ServiceAccount with a projected token whose audience is scoped to the secret store, and passes the store's coordinates to the pod as environment variables. Because the conductor then owns one ServiceAccount per pipeline, the chart also adds a ServiceAccount rule to the conductor's Role. Which vaults a pipeline reads, and the path each serves, come from Vault resources bound to the pipeline's components — not from chart values.

### Configuration

```yaml
pipeline:
  vault:
    enabled: true
    address: http://openbao.openbao.svc.cluster.local:8200
```

## Additional Monitoring Panels

The platform ships with built-in monitoring panels. You can add custom panels or override built-in ones by providing an additional panels file via a ConfigMap.

### Configuration

1. Create a ConfigMap with your custom panels:

```shell
kubectl create configmap custom-panels --from-file=panels.yml
```

Where `panels.yml` follows this format:

```yaml
panels:
  - id: my-custom-panel
    title: "Custom Metric"
    description: "My custom monitoring panel"
    category: streaming
    query: 'rate(my_custom_metric_total{service_name="{{pipeline_id}}"}[5m])'
    unit: ops/s
    visualization:
      type: line
      suggestedStep: 15s
```

2. Mount it and set the path in your Helm values:

```yaml
conductor:
  extraVolumes:
    - name: custom-panels
      configMap:
        name: custom-panels
  extraVolumeMounts:
    - name: custom-panels
      mountPath: /opt/config/panels.yml
      subPath: panels.yml
      readOnly: true

monitoring:
  panels:
    additionalPanelsPath: /opt/config/panels.yml
```

Panels with matching `id` values override the built-in defaults. New `id` values are added alongside the built-in panels.

# Install
